1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
–They made it because... well,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,280
as he says: it just worked out!

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,030
But it worked out that well
that they didn’t believe it at the time.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,700
We followed on the path of metal, and we took Parabellum to a higher place.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,760
–Parabellum? No, well, Parabellum is not an evil band

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,420
we are not evil anymore.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,570
We are anarchist, sexuated, and crazy, and libertine

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,690
but we don’t hate that much anymore.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
It was the rage and the hate,

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
so we set the guitars as strident as possible.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,240
–Then we took that music and we started to send it outside,

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,200
we exchaged it.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,910
Like: Look, listen to this! We have a metal so good 
that you won’t believe it is from Colombia

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,350
–After that concert, there were some issues,
some problems in the band, 

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,650
Cipriano and I ended with some hard feelings.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,080
Then we retired and shook off from the scene.

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
–  BEHIND SCENES  –

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100
–  P A R A B E L L U M  –

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,600
–  The Devil Was Born In Medellin  –

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,970
–We are in Alex Tattoo Studio in Medellin,

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,840
El Pobado neighborhood.

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,680
In 1987 we were forming Ekhymosis

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
I formed Masacre in 1988

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,600
Masacre is what it still is:
27 years playing metal

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,270
I think the metal scene in Medellin
starts at the beginning of the 80s

26
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,580
By the year…

27
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,630
I may say in 1984

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Parabellum is formed,

29
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,380
then after Parabellum other 
bands came up such as Mierda.

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,650
The very first time I saw them playing 
it was in Manrique neighborhood

31
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,700
at Manrique Parking

32
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,000
We already had references
for a band called Parabellum

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,300
and see them playing was impressing!

34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,680
It was seeing a real band with a force 
and power that no other band had,

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,520
and even today I think no one 
has ever played as Parabellum did.

36
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,790
–Yes, I live here with my auntie.
She lives on the second floor.

37
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,310
Here is where we rehearsed.
It was a kind of...

38
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,320
There it was a wall, here another wall,

39
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,870
there were no windows.

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,260
It was a room... a little-dark room,

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,160
we locked down us here, we turned the light off, and 
we started to improvise hard songs, to play hard.

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,610
Here, to escape with the girls.

43
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,440
I born this way, I suffer a hip dislocation.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,690
My spine was twisting... but not anymore,

45
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,220
a bioenergetic treated me

46
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
and he fixed a lot of things.

47
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,690
Okay, lets go!

48
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,350
–Are we going to?
–To Laureles

49
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,090
I used to live around here

50
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,330
This neighborhood is very cool

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,430
There is a lot of rockers, guys and girls.
(Straight forward is easier)

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,800
Here was my first time playing covers of 
Plasmatics, Hypnotics, Rumble [Rumble Militia],

53
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,960
of various hard bands. In that garage.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,950
Someone throw us a glass bottle 
from that building

55
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,530
I still ignore who could be.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,450
–Parabellum is a band that... it was not called Parabellum at first

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,940
it was called Juana La Loca

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
–It's Latin, it means 'Prepare for war'

59
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,020
It seemed a logical name for us.

60
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,420
'Juana La Loca' because of madness and so,

61
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,220
but we wanted a most concrete name for what we were going to do

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,750
that was to prepare the war against everything.

63
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,490
–Medellin at that time was...

64
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,690
just like the music: pure madness.

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,050
It was a very distorted moment.

66
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,160
Like if the city was being shaken all the time,

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,760
shaken by bombs, laws, problems

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,010
with values that make no sense,

69
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,660
with a corrupted politic

70
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,070
knowing the city was being directly
controlled by the Medellin Cartel,

71
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,720
and with rockers and metalheads
which we were a part aside

72
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,410
as we have nothing to do with the conflict

73
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,930
and we weren't interested either in the social,
politics or religion; only our music

74
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,710
–We were very rebels.
We were 17 - 18 years old

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,010
by 1981 we were talking about forming a band

76
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,560
it was when I started to study guitar

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,870
and Cipriano started to study drums/percussion too

78
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,510
He visited me at home

79
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
there we started to created music and rhythms,

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
and to record them.

81
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,480
Later we connected with Ramón,
further with John Jairo

82
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,630
–What's up?

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,750
–What's up? How are you doing?
–How are you doing?

84
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,660
–I'm fine!
–What's the pet's name?

85
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,720
–Eh, Minea

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,310
In 1985 specifically was when I formed the band

87
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,890
with the capability to play metal 
and with the instruments.

88
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,150
In 1985 I started with 'El Gato'
and Federico López

89
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,250
to assemble some music.

90
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,640
Later in 1987 we offer our 
first concert, in September

91
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,510
In 1988 we entered to a studio
at Raimond Records

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,960
to recording our first LP

93
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,240
which by chance ended being
the first metal LP from Colombia

94
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,110
Well...

95
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,010
I remember once we were
in downtown

96
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,410
and suddenly appeared
a very strange thing

97
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,240
with long hair almost until it knees

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,760
you couldn't guess if that was
walking forward or backward

99
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,260
We start talking

100
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,630
I smoked a lot of weed at that time,

101
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,260
but this man only drinks milk and cake,

102
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,770
now is the opposite.

103
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,050
–Totally straight edge!

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,920
–Anyway... Everything was cool,

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
and Parabellum was tremendous impressive!

106
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Since I heard Parabellum,
and that's why I recognized him,

107
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,330
because I already knew Parabellum.

108
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,220
I didn't attend the two gigs
at Parqueadero Manrique

109
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,560
but I did at Battle Of The Bands...

110
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,760
A very crazy thing!

111
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,280
A tremendous thing!

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,400
– BATTLE OF THE BANDS 1985 –

113
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,910
That concert promised that
the most voted band by the public

114
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,270
will be rewarded with recording a disc.

115
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,060
So the people started to communicate:

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,090
"Hey, Parabellum will play!"

117
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,080
"Mierda will play!"

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,060
"Danger will play!"

119
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,190
I'm talking about the people
that lived in the slums

120
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,300
what we call lower 'estrato'
(Lower social class)

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,520
There was another higher 'estrato'

122
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,310
people from El Poblado, Envigado,

123
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,770
that were supporting bands as Kraken, Spol, etc.

124
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,490
that wanted to be rockstars,
become famous, etc.

125
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Once Parabellum started to play

126
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,120
that event became a shit!

127
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,120
A big shit!

128
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,010
The people startet to show...

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,150
As I haven't been to a Parabellum concert before,

130
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,870
it was brutal to me!

131
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,590
It was a bestial sound!

132
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,910
No one knew such a sound before.
Nowhere.

133
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,010
After Parabellum it was Kraken's turn

134
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,340
but Kraken couldn't even
make it to the stage!

135
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,820
Because when people knew
that the next band was Kraken,

136
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,390
the people became really angry

137
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,350
and started to throw rocks, 
and anything they found.

138
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,330
The people from the stands took the signs
that were placed on the seats,

139
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,250
they were throwing things
down to the arena,

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,570
the people from the arena were
throwing things up to the stands...

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,780
They almost throw down
the scaffolding

142
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,250
in the middle of the plaza Macarena,
down on the ground...

143
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,090
It was a very violent thing!

144
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,159
Right there was evident
the division between

145
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,640
the commercial sound and
the 'underground' sound

146
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,730
in the Medellin scene

147
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,100
As Kraken didn't play,

148
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,900
people thought that
the disc recording prize

149
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,950
was going to be to Parabellum,

150
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,180
as everyone was in
favor of Parabellum,

151
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,070
but six months later,

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,150
it was released 'Kraken' disc

153
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,480
–Hmm

154
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,320
Where is that building is
where first was the church

155
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,100
Once we all got arrested after
a concert we offered there

156
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,850
As I understand,

157
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
the priest, after renting us
the church for $8.000 pesos

158
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,990
called the police saying

159
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,800
the ELN guerrilla took over the place,

160
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,720
so the police came 
shooting into the air

161
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,290
and kicking us all out of here.

162
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,430
The priest got scared when he saw
that many 'crazy' people,

163
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,630
He was confused.

164
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,070
Those were really hard times.

165
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,690
We ended up arrested
almost always.

166
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,350
–Right.

167
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,450
There was no respect 
for the people or anything.

168
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,290
–Yes. We all were bullied us a lot.

169
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,490
You couldn't walk freely
in some places because

170
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,210
you risk someone cuts your hair,

171
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,760
or throw glue into your head
to force you to cut it,

172
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,970
or things like that, etc.

173
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,960
It was a problem.

174
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,300
Very repressive actions
from the authorities

175
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,430
or "authorities" in quotation marks,

176
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,520
and the Christianism - Catholicism

177
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,620
very dogmatic here,

178
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,790
totally conservative; 
almost fascist

179
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,600
that restricted a lot of opportunities
for young people at that time,

180
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,380
when we were young, right?

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,910
That may explain the social reaction

182
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,090
and the aggressivity,
the violence toward us.

183
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,050
–Let's go to 6 p.m. Mass, 
6 p.m. Mass!

184
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,530
We'll be right back!

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,430
–We want a 'tasty' cookie
[church wafer]

186

–(What a beautiful 'mammies')

187
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,060
(hello, pretties!)

188
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,650
BM

189
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,010
–Who makes the contacts with foreign companies?

190
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,920
–I am the one in contact
with the foreign market

191
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,230
mainly with people
from Europe,

192
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
Alex makes the contact with
people from South America

193
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,700
–Mauricio "Bull Metal" was a guy
that made contacts

194
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,790
with people in Europe
and the United States.

195
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,100
He was the first who wrote
to the Norwegians,

196
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
to Euronymous of Mayhem.

197
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
In letters they sent letters to us,
they said they had metal

198
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,380
but a rollerskaters metal,
a jumping metal.

199
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,980
A metal more like Anthrax or Metalica,

200
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,830
not a raw metal as you guys have there 
(in Colombia)

201
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,360
–To say that Scandinavian metal
came from Parabellum

202
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,620
is a thesis that has circulated
in the scene, right?

203
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,170
–Norwegian metal is almost...

204
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,870
is almost born with Mayhem

205
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,310
Venom is from 1979

206
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,060
They released their major album
in 1982:

207
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,270
Black Metal by Venom

208
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,970
Parabellum is from 1984

209
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,200
Mayhem is from 1984 - 1985

210
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,000
They took that raw and abrupt sound,
and start to associate it with religion.

211
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
They start to enter into the obscure.

212
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,760
They start to use makeup,

213
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,510
to radicalize themselves more,

214
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,710
to arson on churches,

215
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,910
a murder of a homosexual,

216
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,110
to attack prostitutes...

217
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,460
Basically against everything they think
is not the way they think it should be.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,070
–The hardest thing we had to exchange
with Mayhem was Parabellum

219
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
so we sent Parabellum,

220
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,160
then they said it was impressive

221
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,300
a metal band like Parabellum
existed in Colombia

222

–[UNINTELLIGIBLE], OH!, DIRTY WORLD–

228
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,770
–The thing with the sound,

229
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,350
it was because of the lack of
knowledge and technique we had

230
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,930
–Also...

231
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
–As I said...

232
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,510
–Also the tools..
–Exactly, the tools we had were very...

233
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,470
very...

234
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,150
–Precarious
–Precarious. Very scarce,

235
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
for example, the distortions
were made by friends

236
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,770
who half knew about...

237
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,000
–(Electronics)
–Electronics,

238
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,190
so they make us a distortion
that sounded barely similar,

239
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,580
that's why it sounded
that strident.

–HOMICIDAL SCIENCE, IT'S JUST APPEARANCE–

–DAMN WITCH, DON'T INTERMIT–

244
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,170
The music was half-chromatic
and half-melodic

245
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,400
so when combined it sounded hard,

246
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,300
and because of the dark lyrics too;

247
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
and our method had that intention,

248
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,190
making things with deep feelings
and rigorous work.

249
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,360
–It wasn't only Parabellum,

250
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,260
later we send to them
Reencarnación,

251
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,340
Eh... Masacre too;

252
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,360
they had a place
that was like...

253
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,820
like a cave,

254
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,680
where they met to drink 
and listen to music.

255
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,450
The walls were scratched
with bands logos

256
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,040
and there was Parabellum,
Reencarnación, Masacre...

257
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,470
They said there was a special place,
a cult, for Colombian metal.

258
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,270
–I think it's the sort of thing
that happens by chance,

259
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,980
things arrive there, things arrive here;
they mix.

260
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,790
Someone gets interested
in something.

261
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,660
The same way as I was
interested in Parabellum,

262
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,090
Maybe Mayhem was
interested in Parabellum,

263
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,090
in Reencarnación.

264
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,170
–Oh, no. My family was very relaxed,              
they never felt uncomfortable about this.

265
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,690
They got a little bit scared                    
when we released Sacrilegio...

266
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,079
because of the cover...

267
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,319
because we 'improve' the Virgin.

268
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,140
People was scared of that!

269
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,369
We just wanted to spit on everything,

270
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,790
so... we will release it this way, you like it or not!

271
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,570
While recording the first Sacrilegio album
we had a lot of problems

272
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,200
I think God didn't want us to record that disc
because we were very evil

273
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,280
but we made it anyway with the Devil's help.

274
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,210
During the first record sessions,
we had several issues.

275
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,590
When they placed the vinyl to make the first copies,
the main equipment got burned literally,

276
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,170
they had electricity cuts, suddenly equipment malfunction,
and even the studio was frightening;

277
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,350
so they blamed us for all that
because we were a very dark band,

278
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,090
And they banned us! After releasing Sacrilegio
they never allowed us to record there anymore.

279
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,360
(DISCOS FUENTES LOGO)

280
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,830
In 1985 was the concert at La Macarena,

281
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,230
after La Macarena concert we had another concert
with Mierda, at Parqueadero Manrique.

282
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,880
After that concert, there were some issues,
some problems in the band,

283
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,060
also with Mierda members too.

284
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,270
Cipriano and I ended with some hard feelings
because of that situation with them.

285
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,460
Then we retired and shook off the scene...

286
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:40,610
–Its raw, dark, and strident sound 
called as 'Ultra Metal', made Parabellum 
a cult band for the underground metal.–

287
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,970
In 1987 we recorded Sacrilegio,

288
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,430
and in 1988, Mutación Por Radiación;

289
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
but the band was already disintegrated. 

290
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,920
I insisted on recording the songs
for they don't disappear into the air.

291
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,800
Cipriano didn't want anything anymore,

292
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,430
the other members were gone.

293
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,680
I was the only one who wanted
to left proof of what we have done,

294
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,740
and let it spread. 

295
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,200
–In 1998, guitar, John Jairo Martínez
was murdered in a fight.–

296
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,650
–In 1986, Ramón Restrepo, vocals,
formed Blasfemia, a Medellin's black metal
cult band that is still performing.–

297
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,640
–I think the scene ended for them

298
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,280
because punk and hardcore arrived,

299
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,130
and...

300
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,280
I think, maybe that led
each of them to other things.

301
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,980
Maybe they realized that

302
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,810
writing always about 'Satan' or 
against religion was not longer the way, 

303
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,930
instead move towards social critic.

304
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:46,000
–After leaving the band, Tomás Cipriano, Parabellum lyrics and drums,
made a cameo in Rodrigo D. No Futuro movie,
where 'La Bruja' also participated in the sound.–

305
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,410
–After the movie premiere, and form punk bands
as HP.HC and Rebelión, Cipriano left the scene.– 

306
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,220
–He is currently living in the outskirts of Medellin
and refused to declare anything for this documentary–

307
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,900
–Carlos Mario is someone who made big things 
for the music, for the metal of the world.

308
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,690
What Parabellum did...
they set a bar very high,

309
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,580
I think absolutely no one can erase that,

310
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,150
no one can forget that,

311
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,800
no one can deny that.

312
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,000
Nowadays they could be one of
the biggest bands in the world.

313
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,920
If they were still performing,

314
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,670
I'm sure they would be as important
as Mayhem, Bathory, or Venom.

315
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,250
–(Thank you! So cool. Bye!)–

316
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,730
–We are with Víctor Raúl, 'Piolín'.

317
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,270
(Well, I don't know why the 'Tweety Bird' nickname,
but we made a lot of fun of it.)

318
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,520
People said that he liked a lot the 'birds' (dicks),
but I can't confirm!

319
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,210
–Hahaha
–Hahaha

320
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,370
(No? I'm so sorry, dude.)

321
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,300
–It was at first grade in primary school,
Principal called me that once.

322
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,480
–Ah, alright

323
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,810
We made a lot of fun for that anyway.
